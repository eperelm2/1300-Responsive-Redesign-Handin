    <h1>Responsive Redesign of a Webapplication</h1>
    <h2 class="below-header">A Responsive Redesign of Southern Air Charter's Home Page </h2>
    <img class="first-picture" src="Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 11.06.13 PM.png">

    <h2 class="body-text">Overview</h2>
    Throughout this redesign, I analyzed Southern Air's website's usability and accessibility. 
    I examined the responsiveness of their homepage to examine how different elements on the page 
    interact with each other. Additionally, I inspected their current accessibility features.
    <br> <br>

    <!-- that i intend to target -->

    I began redesigning their page by brainstorming sketches of a new potential design. From here, 
    I moved to create three annotated low-fidelity wireframes for various screen size (computer, tablet, and phone). 
    I pointed out key differences in my design to address prominent usability issues. Next, I progressed to create a 
    style guide for the redesign, including principal components and layout schemes. After, I 
    designed three high-fidelity mockups based on the elements of my style guide. Lastly, I programmed 
    the new interface, utilizing my high-fidelity mockups. I incorporated basic design principles, such as 
    alignment and visual hierarchy, as well as hierarchical CSS styling and functional responsiveness. 

    <h2 class="body-text">Motivation</h2>
    Southern Air is a Bahamian owned Charter Company that has direct flights between different Bahamian Islands and neighboring areas.
    <br> <br>
    Not too long ago, I tried to book a flight offered by Southern Air. 
    When I first 
    loaded the website, I instantly became confused about how to book my flight 
    and scroll down the page. The poor color contrast and font sizing provided 
    limited structural hierarchy and difficulty when trying to navigate the site. I had used many different 
    airline websites before this experience. However, none of my previous knowledge applied 
    to how to navigate the page.

          - It's different from most air travel websites; need to learn new UI <br>
          - I needed to look around the website to see where to buy a flight; unintuitive UI <br>

      <tr>
        <th>Memorability</th>
        <th> - Since it is unlike other air travel websites, if you are not buying flights through Southern Air frequently, it's easy to forget how it works

        <th>Efficiency</th>
        <th>
          - You have to scroll down to buy a flight; I expected the booking option to be the first thing I saw <br>
          - You have to read warning messages first –- seems more important than buying the flight <br>
          - If you are not on the home page, you don’t have access to the same features (ie, the top bar goes away) <br>
          - There is no way to change your flight without starting the process over

        <th>Design</th>

    <h3>Wave Report</h3>
    <div >
      The main takeaway from the WAVE Report is the 
      abundance of color contrast errors: almost all text 
      on the page has color contrast errors. Additionally, 
      the text has poor alignment, placement, and size accessibility.
       There are also many issues with labels, alternative text, and aria 
       labels, limiting the site's accessibility.   </div>

     <h2 class="body-text">Takeaways and limitations</h2>   
     Overall, I investigated flaws and usability errors when resizing and interacting with the 
     Southern Air website. I practiced applying necessary usability terms, such as aria-labels
      and HTML hierarchical labels. I saw how to construct HTML elements that responsively 
      resize to different screen sizes. Additionally, I explored problematic color layouts and 
      hierarchies and how these elements could benefit from a responsive redesign.
        <br> <br>
      In my redesign, you may notice that the dropdown button that appears in the navbar when the 
      screen is resized lacks certain qualities, detail, and depth that a dropdown button typically 
      possess. These drawbacks are due to the limitations of access to non-paid icons.
