    <h1>Responsive Redesign of a Webapplication</h1>
    <h2 class="below-header">A Responsive Redesign of Southern Air Charter's Landing Page </h2>
    <img class="first-picture" src="Screenshot 2024-03-06 at 11.06.13 PM.png">

    <h2 class="body-text">Overview</h2>
    Throughout this redesign, I analyzed and explored the usability and accessibility of Southern Air’s web page. 
    I looked into the responsiveness of their homepage to examine how different elements on the page interacted 
    with each other. I also inspected the accessibility features that previous developers had neglected.
    <br> <br>

    I began redesigning their page by brainstorming sketches of a new potential design. From here, 
    I moved to create three annotated low-fidelity wireframes, one for each screen size (computer, tablet, phone). 
    I pointed out key differences to address prominent usability issues. Next, I progressed to create a 
    style guide for the redesign, including principal components and layout schemes. Additionally, I 
    designed three high-fidelity wireframes based on the elements of my style guide. Lastly, I programmed 
    the new interface, utilizing my high-fidelity frames. I incorporated basic design principles, such as 
    alignment and visual hierarchy, as well as hierarchical CSS styling and functional responsiveness. 

    <h2 class="body-text">Motivation</h2>
    Recently, trying to buy a flight on a very niche and limited path, 
    I had to interact with the Southern Air interface. I instantly became confused with how to book 
    my flight, as well as how to scroll down on the page. The poor color contrast and font-sizing 
    only confused me more, with providing limited structural hierarchy and how to navigate the site. 
    I had used many different airline websites before this experience, however, none of my previous 
    understanding and knowledge applied for how to navigate the page.

    <h3>Wave Report</h3>
    <div >
      The main takeaway from the WAVE Report is the abundance of color contrast errors; almost every text on the
     page has color contrast errors. Additionally, the text has poor alignment, placement, and size accessibility. 
     There are also many issues with labels, alternative text, and aria labels, limiting the accessibility of the site.

     <h2 class="body-text">Takeaways and limitations</h2>   
     Overall, I investigated flaws and usability errors when resizing and interacting with the Southern Air
      website. I practiced applying necessary usability terms, such as aria-labels, HTML hierarchical labels, 
      and alt tags. I saw how to construct HTML elements that responsively resize to different screen sizes. 
      I explored problematic color layouts and hierarchies and how these elements could benefit from a responsive 
      redesign. 
        <br> <br>
      In my redesign, you may notice the dropdown button that appears when the screen is resized lacks certain
      qualities, detail, and depth that a dropdown button typically possess. This is due to the limitations of 
      availability for non-paid icons.
